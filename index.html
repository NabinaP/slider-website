						Dear Students / Parents / Guardians,

Thank you for your interest in Ambition Academy. This is a unique school with a particular and very special ethos. Put simply, it is our core aspiration that during their time with us, every individual student makes a positive difference - a difference to their own lives and difference to the lives of others. Our objective is to help our students to achieve their full potential in every area of school life. We have a long and proud

Our students and our outstanding staff team are our two most precious assets. Such is the caliber of our young people from over 70 districts. We believe that there is no limit to what they can achieve. While we have high expectations and are ambitious for our students, we also know that for them to succeed, we need to provide a caring, supportive and challenging environment in which they can grow and flourish.

We stress to all of our young people that what really matters is not gaining qualifications for their own sake but learning – always being open to personal growth, having a mindset that welcomes and tackles problems, being resilient when times get tough. We strive to ensure that our young people leave Ambition Academy with a set of values and perspective on life that leads them to succeed in whatever they wish to do.

Ambition Academy offers an extraordinary number of opportunities, both within our taught curriculum and beyond. This is a proven school with great spirit and a sense that anything and everything is possible.

We are family oriented, believing that working in partnership with families is best way to train students for mission, service and leadership. Parents provide awesome leadership and assistance in making this institution a great place for children.

We hope you can discover how Ambition Academy can benefit your child. For a more complete picture of what our facility and staff can offer, consider visiting us during the school day. Please call or email us to arrange an appointment.

We look forward to hearing from you.
